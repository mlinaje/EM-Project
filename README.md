# FairS4U (Fair Storage for Ubiquitous Computing)
The aim of this fork is to extend the original contributions made in the original Alfonos Galan's Project. 

The objective is to get a fair (regarding computing and storage capabilities, but also power consumption and other sensor node features) Distributed Data Storage with replicas using the sensor/actuator nodes already available in the sensor network.

This will provide several advantages, as we fully explain in this paper (free download): https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8819993
